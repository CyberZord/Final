            Hey again! Here on this About Me page, I'll provide you with some information 
            about me that you hopefully haven't heard before!</p>
        <p> But before I get into my little autobiography, I'll briefly tell you what kind of person I am.
            As I've said in my introductory video and home page, I'm a video game nerd with a desire to strengthen
            my coding abilities. In addition to that, I am more of a quiet, timid person who prefers to keep to himself
            rather than seek out people to talk to. At least, that's how I generally am. With friends & family, I am
            a bit more outgoing, but nothing too crazy.
        </p>
        <p>Now for a short little autobiography about me: I was born in Ookaloosa, Florida on August 7th, 2002.
            I've moved across the country a few times over the years, going to states like Alaska, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota,
            North/South Dakota, and eventually found mysellf in Montana in 2015, where I would stay for the next 7 years.
            I currently live with my 3 younger brothers and my parents. And that's all I've really got for this short little autobiography.
        </p>
        <p>Hope you enjoyed reading and learning more about me! :) - Craig Nordin (AKA CyberZord on most platforms)</p>
